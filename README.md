# Arcanum RSS

This is a simple RSS reader that I made to learn Rust and Tauri. I wanted something quite simple to use daily to read my feeds.
It is relatively quick, looks nice and is definitely not finished. It only works online because it doesn't cache images.

## How to use
You can download a prebuilt binary from the [releases](https://github.com/dhonus/arcanum/releases) page. 
You can also build it yourself with `npm run tauri build`.
